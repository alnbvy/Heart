## General Information
- In this project, various machine learning algorithms were utilized to predict heart diseases using clinically gathered data
- The projects contains, feature engineering, data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visulization and model development.
- Models include: 1) Linear regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, Neural Network, etc..
